<h1>Blockchain</h1>


    <h4>
    <p>A blockchain is a type of database made up of a connected line of groups of data. Each group of data is called a “Block”. Each block is time-stamped with the exact moment it was created (The moment the block is completely filled with data), and has a set data size. Once all the space in a block has been filled with data, it is time-stamped and added onto the end of the current chain of blocks, and a new block is created.</p>

    <p>Blockchains are used in cryptocurrencies as a method of keeping track of cryptocurrency transaction data. Blockchains are essentially publicly viewable ledgers that anyone can add onto and verify. When blockchains are used within cryptocurrencies, the blockchain is almost completely irreversible as the blockchain of a cryptocurrency is a publicly viewable and editable database. Many different entities would have their own copies of the blockchain which can be compared and audited with other copies of the blockchain to make sure that transaction data is not retroactively edited.</p>

    <p>The cryptocurrency blockchain process starts off initially when a new transaction is entered. The cryptocurrency transaction is then sent to many different users of the cryptocurrency, who then verify the legitimacy of the transaction by solving equations. Once the transaction is confirmed to be legitimate, the transaction data is added to a block, along with other cryptocurrency transaction data. After the block is filled with transaction data, it is added to the chain of blocks and is almost impossible to change at this point. The transaction is logged and completed, and the cycle repeats again with another transaction.</p>
