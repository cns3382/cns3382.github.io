<h1>Economic Freedom</h1>

<h4>
    <p>Many research on economic freedom have been conducted all across the world. A high GDP per capita is obviously linked to economic freedom. Countries that have forbidden or heavily regulated bitcoin are low in terms of economic freedom and have low GDP per capita. These oppressive governments contribute to the poverty of their people.Individuals, particularly those in third-world nations and those subject to economic sanctions, benefit from cryptocurrency.  Due to fewer laws, the crypto market is easier to access than traditional banks, allowing citizens to avoid governments and restrictions in order to mine for cryptocurrency rewards to use, sell, and convert for common products in order to survive.</p>
    <p> Cryptocurrencies have long been studied and argued, but they're just now becoming widely recognised as financial tools that can be used by those who aren't cryptophiles. By providing better access to cash and financial services, cryptocurrencies have the potential to enable social and economic growth around the world, even in underdeveloped countries. <p> There is a beneficial rise in economic activities - The recent increase of the cryptocurrency business, as evidenced by early adopters who became wealthy overnight and discovered new financial prospects. Bitcoin, the most well-known of these cryptocurrencies, has already enabled many people and businesses to grow and prosper, and many individuals rely on trading as a source of income. The economy is steadily adapting to these demands, and cryptocurrencies have a lot of potential to meet them.
    <p> Great opportunities for poorly banked countries- More than a third of the world's population lacks access to basic banking services such as loans and checking accounts e.t.c, which could help them in the event of a personal financial crisis.These people, who are usually already financially disadvantaged, are more likely to use unethical and risky loan tactics. The interest rate charged by these activities is far from fair, leading to increased instability among those who applied for the loan. Cryptocurrencies, with their extreme volatility and ease of usage, are ideal for this. <p> Low transaction costs- Because cryptocurrencies and blockchain don't require a physical location to operate, transaction costs are low. Employee salary, electricity expenses, and rent do not need to be paid, therefore these savings automatically evolve into cheap transaction costs.As a result, more people are beginning to trust these new financial technologies and begin transacting, allowing the global economy to become more linked. You can even trade with no minimum deposit requirements, depending on the broker you choose.<p>
