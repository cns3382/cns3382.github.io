<h1>CRYPTOCURRENCY</h1>


</ul>
<p>We chose Cryptocurrency to be our topic for our group presentation as Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin entered 
the limelight a few years ago and have had quite an impact on society, governments, and the transaction of money. 
It is also not very well known about in detail to the general public, so we wish to shed some light on its inner 
machinations. </p>
<p>Roles:</p>
<p>- Kheo Dickinson researches Cryptocurrency Mining and the Impact Cryptocurrency has on society. Also manages the Github repository.</p>
<p>- Jun-Liang Tan researches Cryptocurrency Blockchains and the Opportunities and Benefits Cryptocurrency can give to society. Also manages the GitHub repository.</p>
<p>- Jacqui Mehau researches the Economic Freedoms of Cryptocurrencies and the Risks and Ethical issues that come along with it. Also manages the website.</p>
