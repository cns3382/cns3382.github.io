<p>
There aren't many ethical issues involved with cryptocurrencies. They can't really be abused by anyone as it takes a very large amount of computing power to obtain, and those with a stash of cryptocurrencies can only use those cryptocurrencies to pay for goods and services, or exchange for other currencies.

Some might call the volatile nature of the market to be ethically wrong as the value of a currency shouldn't cause monetary issues to the people that own the currency, but that's less of an ethical issue and more of a risk that is undertaken by the people who buy cryptocurrencies.

The only ethical issue with cryptocurrencies is their potential to be used to buy illegal goods and services from the black market and dark web. Cryptocurrencies can be used this way as cryptocurrencies are inherently anonymous, as the only portion of a transaction that can be publicly viewed, is the transaction of the cryptocurrency itself, and as such, the traders of the cryptocurrency cannot be traced back to or found in the real world.

This issue can also been somewhat circumvented, such as when "The Silk Road", a dark web website that was previously used as a black market for illegal goods, was shut down by the FBI, and the creator of the website, Ross Ulbricht, was sentenced to life imprisonment. The FBI were able to track him down by meticulously checking which people were linked to a Bitcoin address, and which Bitcoin addresses were connected to "The Silk Road". This took the FBI several years, but it proved definitively that cryptocurrencies could be traced, but with difficulty, so such attempts at tracking cryptocurrency transactions would only be used if the transactions were impactful enough to get the attention of a government agency.

I personally recommend that people should start using cryptocurrencies in their daily lives, and that countries should begin recognising cryptocurrencies as valid currencies and adopting them as a national currency. If this is successfully implemented worldwide, it would mean that the cryptocurrency that was adopted would become a world currency and it would be a second gold standard.

Such an event would allow the wealth disparity between nations to even out, and allow third world countries to develop at an incredibly fast rate as they would have more wealth due to the cryptocurrency distributing capital uniformly, which would in turn give them access to better technology and techniques.

If every nation decided to adopt cryptocurrencies, it would also allow for the value of the cryptocurrency to become more stable due to government intervention. Governments could work together to keep the global value of the cryptocurrency stable, which would promote even more widespread usage of the currency, and aid in world unification.

The reduction in currency exchange fees would allow for millions, if not billions of dollars in savings across world, which would cause an increase in standards of living, and improve humanity as a whole. The reduced costs of transactions would also grant people more accessibility to the market, increasing competition between companies and businesses, which leads to fairer prices for consumers, and reduces technological stagnation and increasing research and development.

In general, turning a cryptocurrency into a global currency would increase banking security, improve global relations, and better the standard of living for a large proportion of people around the world.
