<h1>Technology Risks</h1>

<h4>
    <p>Cryptocurrency is vulnerable to theft because it is controlled by private keys, anyone who gains access to private keys can move the currency. The ease of theft and the common practice of speculators using multiple cryptocurrencies create an incentive for thieves to deploy worms, because a worm could spread through one cryptocurrency network and then steal all other cryptocurrencies accessible on the victim computers. Security experts aren’t guaranteed to keeping your cryptocurrencies on an internet-connected computer safe, Bugs can also naturally cause damage to cryptocurrency holdings, the danger for bugs can arise when cryptocurrencies are combined with ”smart contracts” cryptocurrency also faces systemic risk including worms, echanges, central authorities and government intervention, peer-to-peer systems, and especially those written in unsafe languages such as C and C++ , are particularly vulnerable to worms.  For cryptocurrencies that minimize the time required to send transactions, this would enable a worm to spread globally in a matter of seconds.</p>
    <p>Exchanges seek to avoid regulation, which means they implode with almost seeming regularity—usually due to a combination of theft and fraud. These exchanges may even participate in active market manipulation.The risks in the cryptocurrency world are multifaceted and diverse, but fortunately most are limited to those who participate. This leads to a natural conclusion. As the philosopher WOPR said in the movie WarGames, "The only winning move is not to play."</p>
