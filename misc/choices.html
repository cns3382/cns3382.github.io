<h1>Technology Choices</h1>

<h4>
    <p>The main party that is impacted by cryptocurrency is the government. The government issues currency and are the ones who give it value according to James Mcwhinney. Since the government controls the fiat currency, they are able to do many things with it such as track currency movement, collect taxes and choose who can benefit from the movement of the currency. Cryptocurrency can also bring about conflicting interests among stakeholders like regulatory pressure from the government. If the cryptocurrency can be adopted and the government accepts it, it can make the legal implications unclear. One of the factors that naturally influence the adoption of cryptocurrency is the cost during a transaction. Payment service providers that accept cryptocurrency and convert to fiat currency fees are generally lower than when compared with fiat currencies. With regards to the transaction fees Bitcoins transaction fees are at a fixed amount, whereas the credit card payments are a percentage of the transaction value. This makes it more cost effective when doing large payments. One of the biggest hurdles of cryptocurrency is the volatility of them. There is a constant change in the market value of crypto and in a way can be induced through the use of news cycles, this encourages the investment of crypto which means an increase in the trades or when individuals or many people make market moving transactions all contribute to volatility. This is probably one of the biggest reasons as to why it is difficult to adopt crypto.
