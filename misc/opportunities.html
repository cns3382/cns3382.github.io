<h1>Technology Opportunities</h1>


    <h4><p><i>World Currency</i> - Cryptocurrencies have the potential to phase out government-sanctioned currencies, and provide the world with a global currency (A currency that doesnâ€™t have any set borders) that could be used anywhere.</p>
    <p><i>Confidentiality</i> - Cryptocurrencies allow for anonymity. People can view the transactions that have occured, but do not necessarily know who is making the transactions.</p>
    <p><i>Authentication</i> - Cryptocurrency transactions are very easy to verify and are always public. As such, it is near-impossible to fake a cryptocurrency transaction.</p>
    <p><i>Storage Security</i> - Once the cryptocurrency is stored in a secure offline location, it cannot be accessed by hackers and other nefarious entities that want the cryptocurrency, making cryptocurrency storage very secure.</p>
    <p><i>Merchant Security</i> - As cryptocurrency transactions cannot be recalled, merchants trading goods and services in exchange for cryptocurrencies do not need to worry about chargebacks or fraudulent transactions.</p>
    <p><i>Decentralized Control</i> - Not issued by any government, allowing it to keep its value even in an economic collapse.</p>
    <p><i>International Usage</i> - Allows for international transactions without exchange rates.</p>
    <p><i>Inflation</i> - They are immune against inflation and deflation, though it is prone to volatile changes in value.
