<p>Ethical Issues<p>
<p> Hacking, including hackathons and other education-related events, is an extremely unethical way to obtain information or money. Crypto-currencies are not designed to aid hackers; they were intended to allow people to pay for things online without relying on institutions to supervise transactions, yet they have been hacked.The problem with crypto-currencies is that anyone with a computer, an internet connection, and hacking skills might theoretically acquire access to money that does not belong to them. It's a security concern, and there will continue to be problems until block chains and bitcoin exchange companies can tighten their grip on the bitcoins in their possession. Volatility is not always an ethical concern, but it is a significant concern with currencies like bitcoin. If the crypto-currency can maintain a stable value, it will be able to attract more users. Its appeal would readily increase if it could stabilise at a higher level of worth.
<p>Personal Reflection<p>
<p> This assessment was difficult for me because I was unfamiliar with the topic we had chosen, which was cryptocurrencies. During my cryptocurrency research, I discovered that it is fairly common in today's generation. Cryptography is used to safeguard transactions and manage the creation of new units in cryptocurrency. In January 2009, Bitcoin, the first and by far most well-known cryptocurrency, was released. There are currently over 1,500 cryptocurrencies available on the internet.
<p>Reccomendation<p>
<p> I recommended that Cryptocurrency is a high-risk investment, with a possibility of losing more than you gain. Only invest money you can afford to lose, and don't expect to make a fortune. Setting investing limitations for yourself may also be beneficial.If you want to gain direct exposure to the demand for digital currency and the projects or enterprises it facilitates, cryptocurrency is a good investment. There's also the possibility that the cryptocurrency project you invest in will fail.Thousands of blockchain startups are competing for attention, and the stakes are high. If more nations begin to see cryptocurrencies as a threat rather than an innovative technology, regulators may crack down on the entire crypto business.Furthermore, I'm not sure if cryptocurrency is beneficial to individuals or not because it may work both ways depending on what you're using it for.
