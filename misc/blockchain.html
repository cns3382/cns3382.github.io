<h1>Blockchain</h1>


    <h4>
    <p>A blockchain is a type of database used by cryptocurrencies that is made up of a connected line of grouped pieces of data (A chain on data). Each group of data is called a “Block”. Each block is time-stamped with the exact moment it was added onto the chain of blocks, and has a set maximum data size. A block is only added to the chain once its data capacity is completely filled.</p>
    <p>Blockchains are used in cryptocurrencies as a method of keeping track of cryptocurrency transaction data. Blockchains are essentially publicly viewable ledgers that anyone can add onto and verify. This makes it a very robust method of tracking transactions, as any fraudulent transactions would be detected, audited, and voiced, by many different entities at the same time. The blockchain is almost completely irreversible as it would require everyone that has a copy of the blockchain ledger to change their copy.</p>
