<h4>
    <p>Crypto currencies that are blockchain based are built upon the idea that the ledger is kept in the public domain. For the cryptocurrency to grow and develop, new blocks need to be added constantly in order to keep up with the pending purchases. In response to carrying out the addition of blocks in the blockchain the “miners” are rewarded with crypto assets.
