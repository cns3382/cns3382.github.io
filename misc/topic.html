<h1>Chosen Technology/Topic: Cryptocurrency</h1>

    <h4><p>Cryptocurrency is a form of digital currency not owned or controlled by any official government. Due to this fact, the value of any cryptocurrency is extremely volatile, and can increase or decrease seemingly at random. They typically do not hold a physical form, as the currency is simply a string of data. However, many people who own cryptocurrencies and use them as a form of payment or as a form of monetary storage, convert the data into a QR code, and/or print the QR code/string of data onto a physical surface so that the cryptocurrency can be store and used at a later point in time.</p><p>We found it important as it has had a profound impact on society, governments, and the transaction of money across the globe. Because of this, we felt that we should notify and explain the inner workings of how cryptocurrencies function so that the general public would have a deeper understanding of how it all works, and would therefore become less hesitant on using it.</p><p>Examples of the different cryptocurrencies we currently have and are being used in our society are Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and Nxt.</p></h4>
