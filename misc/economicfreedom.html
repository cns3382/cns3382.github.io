<h1>Economic Freedom</h1>

<h4>
    <p>Many research on economic freedom have been conducted all across the world. A high GDP per capita is obviously linked to economic freedom. Countries that have forbidden or heavily regulated bitcoin are low in terms of economic freedom and have low GDP per capita. These oppressive governments contribute to the poverty of their people.Individuals, particularly those in third-world nations and those subject to economic sanctions, benefit from cryptocurrency.  Due to fewer laws, the crypto market is easier to access than traditional banks, allowing citizens to avoid governments and restrictions in order to mine for cryptocurrency rewards to use, sell, and convert for common products in order to survive.</p>
