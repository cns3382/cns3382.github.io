<h1>Technology Risks</h1>

<h4>
    <p>Cryptocurrency is vulnerable to theft because it is controlled by private keys, anyone who gains access to private keys can move the currency.The ease of theft and the common practise of speculators utilising numerous cryptocurrencies encourage thieves to utilise worms, as a worm might spread across one cryptocurrency network and then steal all other coins on the victim computers.Security experts cannot guarantee that your cryptocurrency stored on an internet-connected machine will remain secure.Bugs can also harm cryptocurrency holdings, when cryptocurrencies are paired with smart contracts, the risk of bugs increases. Worms, exchanges, central authorities, and government involvement all pose systemic risks to cryptocurrencies. Peer-to-peer systems, particularly those implemented in unsafe languages like C and C++, are particularly vulnerable to worms.This would allow a worm to propagate globally in a couple of seconds using cryptocurrencies that reduce the time it takes to send transactions.</p>
    <p>Exchanges try to escape regulation, which means they implode with near-regularityâ€”usually as a result of a mix of theft and fraud. These exchanges might potentially be involved in market manipulation.The risks associated with cryptocurrencies are numerous and varied, but thankfully, the most are limited to those that participate. This naturally leads to a conclusion. "The only winning move is not to play," stated the philosopher WOPR in the film WarGames.</p>
